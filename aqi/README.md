# Air quality project 

We aimed to access the impact of the air quality on the survival of honeybee in North America using BeeTrack dataset of over 100 000 hives tracked as of now. Once we access the impact, we want to predict the expected impact on mortality of colonies in 2023 which was a high forest fire year resulting in repeated very high AQHI days. (bad air quality)
