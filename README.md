### Data generation

The dataset is from Nectar 1.19 and covers hives from 2020 to 2023. The 2023 season is currently censored in terms of winter mortality but you can analyse the acute effect (which I didn't include in the blog post but I did have a look at the effect on the summer mortality which is even stronger). I also shared the complete daily history for all the yards in the dataset for air quality, NDVI, and weather that was scrapped from [airpyllution package](https://airpyllution.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), [meteostats package](https://dev.meteostat.net/python/#installation) and [earth engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). Finally, you will find a file called 'ops_meta.csv' which contains the region of the given operations. 

The files can be found on this google drive: [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UZ3_jzMRdaQEaIR1TzPqEWTb0azECStB)
